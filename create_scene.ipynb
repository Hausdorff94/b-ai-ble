The servants are expected to invest the talents while the master is away, and when he returns, they will be judged based on how they used their talents.\\n\\nOne servant invests the five talents he received and earns five more, bringing a total of ten talents back to the master. The second servant invests the two talents he received and earns two more, bringing a total of four talents back to the master. The third servant, however, buries the one talent he received and returns it to the master unused, fearful of losing it.\\n\\nThe master is pleased with the first two servants and praises them for their good work. But he is angry with the third servant for not taking any risks and not using his talent to earn more. He takes the one talent away from the third servant and gives it to the servant who earned ten talents, as a reward for his hard work and faith.\\n\\nThe scene ends with the master saying, \"Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master.\" (Matthew 25:21)\\n\\nIn this scene, the master represents God, and the servants represent believers. The talents represent the gifts and abilities given to each person by God. The scene teaches that we will be judged based on how we use the gifts and abilities given to us by God, and that we should take risks and use our talents to earn more for the kingdom of God. The fire that tests the quality of each man\\'s work represents the trials and challenges we face in life, and how we respond to them shows the quality of our faith.'"
